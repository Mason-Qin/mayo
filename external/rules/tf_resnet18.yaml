# Rules to import pytorch ResNet18 pretrained model into checkpoints.
#
# Model:
#     https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/resnet.py
# Weights:
#     https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-5c106cde.pth
#
# Tensors require us to permute them, as their spatial ordering is different
# from tensorflow.
#
# Convolution:
#     torch:      [out_maps, in_maps, kernel_h, kernel_w]
#     tensorflow: [kernel_h, kernel_w, in_maps, out_maps]
